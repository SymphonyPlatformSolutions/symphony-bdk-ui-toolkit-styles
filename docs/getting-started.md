# Getting Started


## Install

To install UIToolkit-Styles on your project you can: 

- Install with **npm**:

First, you will need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.

Install the library from npm by running the following command on your project:

```

Import the css on your project:

If you are using Webpack or other module bundler you can also import the SASS version:

  @import '../uitoolkit.scss';
```


- Install from **CDN**:

Alternatively, you can use the [symphony](https://cdn.symphony.com/resources/ui-toolkit/{master}/css/uitoolkit.css) CDN to load the compiled CSS version.
